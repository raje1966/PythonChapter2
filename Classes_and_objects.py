# Class can have both data and functions.  They are also called as class members.  Class can have both attributes and behavior.  Class members(data and functions) can be accessed with the help of object.
The syntax for class is class class_name:
After that we can put our data and functions within this syntax.  Every argument in the user-defined function starts with self.  Self is an argument in the function that is mandatory.

Object has to be created and the syntax for that is object.name = class.name()
