Will perform only with binary numbers.
| is bitwise or sign.  If any of elements is true, then the outcome is true.  If both are false, then the outcome is false.

& operator - If both are true,then only it will return true, otherwise false.and

^ operator - Any two true or false are compared, it returns false, but if two different values are compared, it will return true.

~ if it is true, outcome is false.  If it is false, then the outcome is true.

<< - left shift - it shifts the number of bits towards left.

>> - right shift - It shifts the number of bits towards right.
